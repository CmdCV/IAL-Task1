# IAL - Algorithms Task 1

## Purpose
This repository serves as a record of my projects throughout my studies at FIT BUT.

## Copy-pasting? Think twice! (Mr.Smrčka will find you)
I know you won’t listen anyway, so at least make sure it’s done properly-let’s avoid meeting at the disciplinary committee. I’m sure neither of us, nor the committee, would be happy about that.

Thank you for visiting!
